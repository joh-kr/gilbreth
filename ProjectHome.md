Software Product Lines are a mean to improve the economic performance of firms that offer several products to a market by systematically reusing software artifacts. In most cases the definitive company goal is profit maximization. That can be reached by increasing revenue or reducing cost. Revenue is increased by offering products with a wide variety of features to an audience willing to pay. However, the fewer features realized the fewer cost incur. Hence, the firm may ask what features are most important to realize. To decide on such questions the Value-Based Portfolio Optimization (VB-PO) approach has been introduced. It is an addition to common scoping approaches to SPLs.

However, an effective use of VB-PO is solely possible with software support. Hence, we are implementing Gilbreth a toolsuite that supports firms in using VB-PO.

Currently, Gilbreth consists of the following sub projects:
  1. [An implementation of a value-based optimization algorithm](http://code.google.com/p/gilbreth/source/browse?repo=default#hg%2Fvbpo)
  1. [A survey tool based on Adaptive Conjoint Analysis with Price Estimation (ACA-PE)](http://code.google.com/p/gilbreth/source/browse?repo=default#hg%2Facape)
  1. [Gilbreth Cockpit, an Eclipse plugin for easy and seamlessly use of VB-PO](http://code.google.com/p/gilbreth/source/browse?repo=default#hg%2Fgilbreth_cockpit)
  1. [Test driver with test data generator for SPPD solution algorithms](http://code.google.com/p/gilbreth/source/browse/de.uni_leipzig.iwi.gilbreth.vbpo.performance.evaluator)
  1. [Collection of example problems](http://code.google.com/p/gilbreth/source/browse/de.uni_leipzig.iwi.gilbreth.vbpo.examples)

All implementations are academic prototypes. They serve for demonstration purposes only!

You need Eclipse 3.6 or higher to be installed to run the tools of the toolsuite. An update site is available at
http://gilbreth.googlecode.com/hg/de.uni_leipzig.iwi.gilbreth.cockpit.update.site/. Copy the link to your install software wizard and select the feature to install. You may want to check the wiki for detailed installation instruction (http://code.google.com/p/gilbreth/wiki/Install_Gilbreth_Cockpit_in_Eclipse).

The project heavily relies on other projects, which have been done an excellent work.
